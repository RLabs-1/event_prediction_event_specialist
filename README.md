### **EventSpecialist**

The **EventSpecialist** repository is a dedicated module in the **Log Events Monitoring and Prediction System** that performs advanced abductive reasoning and causal inference to enhance event predictions. Each EventSpecialist instance focuses on specific event types, enabling deep contextual understanding and reasoning for targeted predictions.

---

### **Features**
- **Causal Inference and Abductive Reasoning**:
  - Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) or custom reasoning engines to provide context-aware predictions.
  - Suggests potential causes and consequences for identified patterns in events.

- **Multi-Type Specialization**:
  - Supports multiple instances, each tailored to specific event types.
  - Allows flexible scaling and specialization across diverse domains.

- **Integration with the System Workflow**:
  - Accepts structured event data from the Event Sequence Model (ESM).
  - Provides enriched predictions to the Ranking Model for prioritization.

- **Customizable Reasoning Logic**:
  - Define reasoning templates and rules for each event type using YAML configurations.
  - Enables precise control over reasoning tasks.

- **Scalable and Modular**:
  - Designed for horizontal scaling to handle increased event throughput.
  - Easily integrates additional EventSpecialist instances for new event categories.
